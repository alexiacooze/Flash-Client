# Flash

This project is an online study tool that has FREE pre-generated flashcard-style questions to aid in learning the core concepts of front-end development.

# The Problem

In many traditional programs, there is an emphasis on theory, and general cs knowledge, and a lack of practical knowledge.

## User Profile

This project is curated for university, college, boot-camp students, or self-learners. This project is also an ideal resource for prepping for the non-technical aspect of front-end software development interviews.


# The Design 

The visual flashcard design was used to aid in creating long-term memory storage. Traditional methods of studying typically include reading, writing out, and re-reading information. This method has not been shown to be as effective in generating long-term memory in a shorter duration of time. Active recall has been shown to have the most effective impact on turning short term, and working memory into long-term memory via re-accessing previously encoding information. Active recall works by recalling brief information that has previously been stored in memory. This is done by thinking of the information, which triggers the brain to replay similar patterns of the neural activity that was originally created during the initial event that created the memory. 

# Tech Stack and APIs

Client: JSX, SCSS, Javascript, and React.
Server: Node.js, Express.js

No external APIs were used. All APIs were creating internally with Node.js and Express.js

# Installation
### `In terminal`

cd flash 
npm i
npm start

The react app will then open in your browser

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
